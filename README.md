# Abstract
 In Sub-Saharan Africa, the intricate domain of mental well-being, which encompasses emotional, psychological, and social aspects, is threatened by various disturbances that can negatively impact cognitive functions and emotional responses. The ever-evolving narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) is transitioning from a concept revered and feared in folklore and modern cinema to a tangible tool of hope in healthcare. Leveraging AIâ€™s transformative capabilities, the present study, rooted in the Kenyan backdrop, adopts machine learning models to elevate the precision and efficacy of mental health evaluations, particularly for diagnosing complex conditions such as depression. The initial findings reveal a notable negative correlation between depression levels and long-term investments or savings, possibly hinting at the adverse financial ramifications of depression. Furthermore, the data unveils nuanced interactions between household size and depression rates, suggesting that larger households might serve as buffers against depression due to enriched social support and cultural bonds. Contrastingly, a higher prevalence of depression was identified amongst married individuals, a complex relationship that necessitates further exploration to understand the underlying dynamics fully.
Despite exhibiting high accuracy scores, the deployed Decision Tree Classifier models, including Model_2 and Model_1, demonstrated limitations in precision, recall, and F1-score, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to diagnosing depression beyond relying solely on datasets. These models, though indicative of depression, cannot, as of now, replace the expertise of licensed clinicians for formal diagnoses. As the trajectory of utilizing AI in mental health evaluations continues to expand, further research is imperative to enhance the accuracy of predictions and foster interventions that safeguard individual and community well-being comprehensively. This study underscores the urgency for refined research methodologies and the critical role of professional mental health interventions in fostering holistic health outcomes in the region.
